# CLAUDE.md — Project Brief for Claude Code Sessions

## What This Repository Is

`eeik_bootstrap` is a **bootstrap and seed repository** — it is not a runnable application. Its purpose is to provide a ready-to-fork configuration base for enterprise projects. Drop the relevant files into any new or existing project to immediately establish:

- GitHub Copilot workspace instructions (`.github/` directory — already in this repo)
- Claude Code agent, command, and standards configuration (`.claude/` directory — this layer)
- Shared quality gates, coding standards, and memory structure

When adopting this seed into a real project, replace all placeholder values (e.g. service names, environment URLs, team names) with project-specific values.

## Generation Engine (v1.4) — governed, versioned

EEIK is evolving from copy-once static config into a **governed generation engine** (posture: an
engine other tools consume, *not* a product platform competing with APEX). Two things follow from that:

- **The engine is a package.** The executable core lives in the installable **`eeik/`** package
  (`pip install -e .` → the `eeik` console script, or `python -m eeik`). `scripts/*.py` are thin
  backward-compatible shims. The repo's *content* layers (`capability-packs/`, `knowledge/`,
  `templates/`, `generators/`, `bootstrap/`) are data the engine reads — not code.
- **Three surfaces, one implementation.** The CLI, the MCP server (`eeik mcp`, ADR-006), and the typed
  Python SDK (`import eeik`, ADR-007) are all adapters over `eeik/api.py`. Add behaviour to the SDK
  (`eeik/api.py`) and let the CLI/MCP delegate — do NOT duplicate logic per surface. The public API is
  `eeik.__all__`; the catalog accessor is `eeik.find_packs()` (not `catalog`, to avoid shadowing the
  submodule).
- **One canonical manifest schema.** `eeik/schemas/manifest.schema.json` is the single source of truth
  (`eeik/manifest.py` enforces it). Do NOT reintroduce a second schema copy.
- **Generators run on HALO.** EEIK's generators are agents; they flow through the `agent-harness`
  runtime (`eeik/generation.py`). Generation is **SUGGEST authority**, so it can never auto-enforce —
  drafts are gated, audited, and staged for human review, and it **fails safe** when HALO is absent.
  Do NOT re-implement a confidence gate inside EEIK — consume HALO's.
  See [ADR-003](docs/decisions/ADR-003-eeik-generators-run-on-halo.md).
- **Packs are versioned dependencies.** Every pack declares a `version` in `metadata.yaml`.
  `eeik lock` pins adopted versions + content digests to `eeik.lock`; `eeik diff` reports drift;
  `eeik upgrade` re-pins. See [ADR-004](docs/decisions/ADR-004-capability-pack-versioning-and-lockfile.md).
- **Packs are composable.** `resolve_packs` consumes each pack's `dependencies.yaml`: a selected pack
  transitively pulls in its declared dependencies (existing-only, cycle-safe — e.g. `agent-harness` →
  `governance`) in trigger-driven mode; explicit `capability_packs.explicit` stays exact and an
  `exclude` still vetoes a pulled-in dependency. `eeik.pack_conflicts()` (SDK) + the `pack-conflicts`
  `eeik doctor` check read an optional `conflicts:` list and surface incompatible resolved pairs.
  Add resolution behaviour in `eeik/packs.py` (`expand_dependencies` / `detect_conflicts`).

CLI: `eeik demo` (offline governed showcase), `eeik lock|diff|upgrade`, `eeik catalog` (queryable pack
index), `eeik architectures` (engine-surfaced reference architectures, ADR-010), `eeik verify`
(conformance gate, ADR-008), `eeik contract` (emit a HALO Agent Contract, ADR-009), `eeik mcp`
(read-model MCP server, ADR-006), `eeik run <gen> --governed`, `eeik seed` (copy the seed set into an
adopting project — the explicit dual-purpose boundary, ADR-011), `eeik lessons` (closed-loop knowledge
capture — HALO/APEX audit logs → staged `LL-NNN` lessons, SUGGEST authority, ADR-012), `eeik doctor`
(diagnose adoption/health problems — deps, HALO/MCP, manifest, resolution, drift, conformance — each
with an actionable fix), `eeik lint` (content-quality lint of pack agents + standards — frontmatter,
name-matches-file, description quality, structure; complements `verify`), `eeik telemetry` (opt-in,
local-first, non-identifying pack/generator usage counters — off by default, no network; ADR/ROADMAP §8).
Tests: `python3 -m pytest tests/ -q`. Keep `docs/progress.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, and
`docs/index.html` in sync when this layer changes.

## How to Use Claude Code Agents

Agents live in `.claude/agents/`. Claude Code automatically selects the most relevant agent based on the `description` field in each agent's frontmatter. You can also invoke agents explicitly by mentioning their name.

**Selection rule:** Read the description of each agent file to understand its trigger condition. The description is written as a precise activation trigger — if your task matches it, that agent will be selected.

**To invoke explicitly:** Reference the agent slug in your prompt:
- "Using the `java-developer` agent, implement the OrderService"
- "Run a `security-auditor` review on this PR diff"
- "Activate `estimator` and give me a P80 estimate for this feature"

**Key agents by domain:**

| Domain | Agents |
|--------|--------|
| Java / Spring Boot | `java-developer`, `java-tech-lead`, `java-tester`, `jacoco-coverage-tester`, `senior-developer` |
| Python | `python-developer` |
| Go | `go-developer`, `go-microservices-engineer` |
| Node / TypeScript | `node-developer`, `typescript-api-engineer` |
| Angular | `angular-developer`, `angular-tester`, `angular-coverage-checker` |
| Architecture | `architect`, `enterprise-architect`, `arb-reviewer` |
| Cloud / Infra | `aws-architect`, `cdk-terraform-helper`, `aws-deploy-helper`, `ci-engineer`, `containerisation-helper`, `kubernetes-engineer`, `devsecops-engineer`, `local-deploy-helper`, `finops-engineer`, `chaos-engineer`, `platform-engineer` |
| Data | `data-engineer`, `data-scientist` |
| Database | `dba-advisor` |
| Quality | `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, `performance-engineer`, `coverage-enforcer`, `test-quality-enforcer`, `tester` |
| AI / ML | `ai-engineer`, `ml-engineer`, `mlops-engineer`, `ai-governance-officer` |
| Agentic AI | `langraph-engineer`, `crewai-engineer`, `autogen-engineer`, `mcp-engineer`, `a2a-engineer` |
| Delivery | `estimator`, `project-tracker`, `business-analyst`, `technical-writer` |
| Operations | `incident-handler`, `rca-agent`, `ops-engineer`, `sre-engineer` |
| Modernisation | `modernization-expert`, `ibmi-modernization-expert` |

## Golden Rules (Non-Negotiable)

These rules apply across ALL code in ALL domains. They are enforced by hooks and reviewed by the `code-reviewer` and `java-tech-lead` agents.

1. **Constructor injection only** — no `@Autowired` on fields; all injected fields are `final`
2. **No hardcoded secrets** — all credentials, API keys, connection strings go to AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables; never committed to source
3. **SLF4J not System.out** — `log.info(...)` with parameterised messages; never `System.out.println()`
4. **SOLID principles** — Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
5. **Domain-Driven Design** — respect bounded context boundaries; no cross-context direct database joins
6. **No `SELECT *`** — always specify explicit column lists in SQL
7. **Parameterised queries only** — never build SQL via string concatenation; use `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` or named JPQL parameters
8. **Conventional Commits** — all commit messages follow `type(scope): description` format
9. **No partial implementations** — every method body is complete; no `// TODO implement this` in committed code
10. **`jakarta.*` in Boot 3.x** — never `javax.*` in Spring Boot 3.x code

---

## Before Writing Code

1. **Pick the correct agent** — check `.claude/agents/` descriptions and activate the right specialist
2. **Read the relevant standards file** — check `.claude/standards/` for the technology you are working in
3. **Read project context** — check `.claude/memory/project-context.md` for environment-specific details
4. **State what you are building** — before generating code, declare: the bounded context, the layer (domain/application/infrastructure/web), and the acceptance criteria
5. **Check for existing patterns** — use `Grep` to find similar existing implementations before inventing new abstractions

## Estimation Formula

Human Days = **Σ Raw Hours ÷ 6.4**

Where: `6.4 = 8 hours/day × 80% efficiency`

The 80% efficiency factor accounts for: meetings, context-switching, PR review cycles, environment issues, code review iterations, and interruptions.

**Confidence ranges:**

| Scenario | Multiplier | Use For |
|----------|------------|---------|
| P50 (Likely) | ×1.0 | Sprint planning baseline |
| P80 (Conservative) | ×1.3 | Sprint commitment |
| P90 (Pessimistic) | ×1.6 | Release planning buffer |

**Typical raw hours by task type:**

| Task | Simple | Moderate | Complex |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| REST API endpoint (Spring Boot) | 2–4h | 4–8h | 8–16h |
| Angular standalone component | 2–4h | 4–8h | 8–12h |
| Unit test class | 1–2h | 2–4h | 4–6h |
| Integration test (Testcontainers) | 2–4h | 4–6h | 6–10h |
| CDK stack (new resource) | 2–4h | 4–8h | 8–20h |
| Database migration script | 1–2h | 2–4h | 4–8h |

Invoke the `/estimate` command or activate the `estimator` agent for a full breakdown.

## Memory and Context

Claude Code reads `.claude/memory/` files at the start of sessions to load persistent context. Use these files to avoid re-explaining the project on every session.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `project-context.md` | Service inventory, environments, auth patterns, key resource names |
| `domain-glossary.md` | Business terminology — what terms mean in this project's domain |
| `decisions.md` | Architecture Decision Log — what was decided and why |
| `constraints.md` | Hard technical and business constraints that must never be violated |
| `patterns.md` | Approved implementation patterns and anti-patterns to avoid |
| `tech-debt.md` | Tech debt register with priority and target sprint |
| `rca-tracker.md` | Incident/RCA status log |
| `session-log.md` | Auto-updated by the `on-stop.sh` hook with each session's changed files |
| `rejected-approaches.md` | Things that were tried and rejected — prevents re-trying failed ideas |

Use `/memory-update` to update these files when significant decisions or changes occur.

## What NOT To Do

- Do NOT use `javax.*` in Spring Boot 3.x code — use `jakarta.*`
- Do NOT use `@Autowired` on fields — constructor injection only
- Do NOT write `SELECT *` in any SQL query
- Do NOT hardcode credentials, API keys, passwords, or AWS account IDs in source code
- Do NOT use `Thread.sleep()` in tests — use `Awaitility.await().until()`
- Do NOT write empty catch blocks — at minimum log the exception at WARN or ERROR level
- Do NOT use `new Date()` or `java.util.Calendar` — use `java.time` (LocalDate, LocalDateTime, Instant, ZonedDateTime)
- Do NOT add new Maven/npm dependencies without checking the BOM and flagging version conflicts
- Do NOT write partial implementations — if a method is not complete, say so explicitly
- Do NOT commit directly to `main` or `master` — always use a feature branch and PR
- Do NOT use `System.out.println()` anywhere in production code — use SLF4J
- Do NOT use `Optional.get()` without a preceding `isPresent()` check or `orElseThrow()`
