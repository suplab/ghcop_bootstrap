# EEIK Bootstrap — Roadmap

This document tracks planned enhancements to the framework. Items are grouped by release milestone.

---

## Platform Posture — engine, not product

As the ecosystem matured, **APEX** grew from an augmentation *plan* into the runnable AI-SDLC
*product*, and **HALO** (`agent-harness`) became the governed agent runtime both APEX and Aether
consume. EEIK's transformation is deliberately **not** to become a competing product platform — APEX
already owns that surface and *consumes EEIK's generators for onboarding*. Instead EEIK evolves from a
passive pile of config + scripts into a **governed generation *engine*** with a stable, programmatic
surface that APEX and CI consume.

The boundaries the ecosystem is built on:

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Governs **generation** (repo/agent/standard scaffolding) | **EEIK** |
| Governs **execution** (confidence gate, tool registry, audit) | **HALO** |
| The **SDLC product** that orchestrates both | **APEX** |
| The **methodology/spec** everything conforms to | **AIEL** |

EEIK's "platform" energy goes into being the thing others call — not a new UI.

## Current Release — v1.x (Stable)

The v1.x line is the current stable baseline. It covers:

- **Core capability packs:** Java, Angular, AWS, Architecture, Core, Governance
- **48 agents** spanning Java, Angular, AWS, Python, Data Engineering, Kubernetes, AI/ML, agentic frameworks, operations, and modernisation
- **24 slash commands** covering the full development lifecycle
- **27 standards** for all primary technology stacks
- **4 safety hooks** (pre-bash-guard, pre-write-guard, post-edit-check, on-stop)
- **Dual-tool support:** Claude Code (`.claude/`) + GitHub Copilot (`.github/`)
- **Cursor and Kiro** configuration stubs

---

## v1.4 — Governed Generation Engine (In Progress)

The platform-transformation track: EEIK stops being copy-once static config and becomes a governed,
versioned, queryable engine. See ADR-003 (generators on HALO) and ADR-004 (pack versioning + lockfile).

### Tier 1 — Structural (Delivered)
- [x] **Governed generation on HALO** — every generator runs through `Harness().invoke(...)`; generation
      is SUGGEST authority, so it can never auto-enforce (gate rule G-5), is audited, and routes drafts
      to human review. Fails safe when HALO is absent. (`eeik/generation.py`)
- [x] **Pack versioning** — every capability pack declares a `version`; three previously un-versioned
      packs (angular, react, belgium-insurance) now carry `metadata.yaml`.
- [x] **Lockfile + drift detection** — `eeik lock` pins adopted pack versions + content digests to
      `eeik.lock`; `eeik diff` reports drift (added/removed/version-changed/content-changed) and gates
      CI with `--exit-code`; `eeik upgrade` re-pins. (`eeik/lock.py`, `eeik/versions.py`)
- [x] **Engine test suite** — `tests/test_engine.py` covers versioning, drift, and the HALO governance
      guarantee (generation never auto-enforces; bypass counter stays 0).
- [x] **Offline showcase** — `eeik demo` runs a generator on the real HALO gate with no API key.

### Tier 1b — Structure & Packaging (Delivered)
- [x] **Installable engine package** — `scripts/` became the importable `eeik/` package with a
      `pyproject.toml` and an `eeik` console entry point (`eeik` / `python -m eeik`). Backward-compatible
      `scripts/*.py` shims remain; CI installs the package and calls `python -m eeik …`. This unblocks the
      Tier 2 SDK/MCP work (consumers import EEIK instead of shelling out).
- [x] **Single canonical manifest schema** — the three divergent schemas (`scripts/schemas/…` and two
      `bootstrap/schemas/…`) are consolidated into one source of truth,
      `eeik/schemas/manifest.schema.json`. This also fixed a latent bug: the validator had been enforcing
      a stale schema that rejected EEIK's own example manifests.

### Tier 2 — Engine surface
- [x] **Pack/agent registry + catalog** — `eeik catalog` builds a machine-readable, queryable index of
      packs, agents, commands, and standards with version + content-digest provenance. Query by `--tag`,
      free-text `--query`, or `--provides <name>` ("which pack provides `java-architect`?"); `--json` is
      the read model the MCP server will expose. All 22 packs are now tagged + categorised.
      (`eeik/catalog.py`)
- [x] **EEIK MCP server** — `eeik mcp` exposes the engine's read model over the Model Context Protocol:
      `eeik_catalog`, `eeik_validate_manifest`, `eeik_resolve_packs`, `eeik_pack_drift`. One live server
      any MCP host calls, replacing drift-prone static adapter files for *queryable* context. Read-only
      in v1 (generation stays governed/staged, ADR-003); testable core + real client↔server round-trip.
      See [ADR-006](docs/decisions/ADR-006-eeik-mcp-server.md). (`eeik/mcp_server.py`, `eeik/mcp_tools.py`)
- [x] **Stable Python API / SDK** — `import eeik` exposes a curated, typed surface (`find_packs`,
      `providers_of`, `validate_manifest`, `resolve_packs`, `pack_drift`, `write_lock`) returning frozen
      dataclasses. The CLI and MCP tools are now thin adapters over it — one source of truth. Consumers
      like apex-sdlc can import EEIK instead of shelling out.
      See [ADR-007](docs/decisions/ADR-007-eeik-public-python-sdk.md). (`eeik/api.py`)
- [x] **apex-sdlc onboarding consumes the engine** — the cross-repo payoff: APEX's onboarding front door
      calls the real engine (manifest validation + pack resolution) via an `EeikEngine` with two backends
      — **SDK** (`import eeik`, in-process) and **MCP** (`eeik mcp`) — falling back to its vendored copy
      when eeik is absent. (apex-sdlc `app/onboarding/eeik_engine.py`, `service.onboard_with_eeik`.)
- [x] **Governed generation over MCP** — `eeik_generate` MCP tool + `eeik.generate()` SDK function run a
      generation through HALO and return a **staged, human-review draft** — never an auto-applied artifact.
      Generation is SUGGEST authority, so the shared core (`eeik/generation.py::run_generation`) guarantees
      `auto_enforced=false`, routes the draft to human review, keeps `confidence_gate_bypass_total=0`, and
      writes to a staging area; the MCP payload flags `autoApplied=false` explicitly. One implementation,
      three surfaces (CLI `demo`/`run`, SDK, MCP). Fails safe when HALO is absent. (`eeik/generation.py`,
      `eeik/mcp_tools.py`, ADR-003/006.)

### Tier 3 — Closing the loop
- [x] **`eeik verify`** — the conformance gate: every declared agent/standard resolves to a file, the
      manifest validates, and the lock matches. Findings are fail/warn/pass; `--exit-code` / `--strict`
      gate CI. On all three surfaces (CLI, `eeik.verify()` SDK, `eeik_verify` MCP tool).
      See [ADR-008](docs/decisions/ADR-008-conformance-gate.md). (`eeik/verify.py`)
- [x] **Reconcile pack metadata with shipped files** — the 30 conformance gaps are resolved: phantom
      declarations trimmed, `X-standard`→`X` renames aligned to real files, shipped-but-undeclared files
      declared (e.g. `spring-security-engineer`, `cobol-standard`), and the genuinely-missing
      `insurance-compliance-standard` authored (mirroring banking/healthcare). `eeik verify --strict`
      is now clean (0 fail / 0 warn / 21 pass); the catalog/SDK advertise only agents/standards that exist.
- [x] **Agent-generator emits HALO Agent Contracts** — `eeik contract` / `eeik.agent_contract()`
      deterministically emit an `agent-contract.schema.json`-conformant contract from a blueprint:
      the archetype fixes the authority ceiling, which fixes capabilities + gate threshold (never below
      0.80), tool allowlist (supervisors hold none), and safe failure behaviour. All 8 blueprints validate
      against HALO's own validator. Closes the chain: EEIK generates against HALO's contract schema → HALO runs it.
      See [ADR-009](docs/decisions/ADR-009-agent-generator-emits-halo-contracts.md). (`eeik/contract.py`)
- [x] **Closed-loop knowledge capture** — done (ADR-012). `eeik lessons --from audit.json` /
      `eeik.capture_lessons()` / `eeik_capture_lessons` (MCP) ingest HALO/APEX audit records, select the
      learnable ones (blocks, alerts, sub-0.80-confidence human-review outcomes), group them by theme, and
      draft `LL-NNN` lessons — **governed as SUGGEST authority**: staged under `.eeik-staging/lessons/`,
      `auto_enforced=false`, never auto-committed. A human curates Root Cause / Fix and promotes. Closes
      the loop `HALO/APEX audit → staged lesson → knowledge base`. (`eeik/lessons.py`)

### Tier 4 — Directory structure (Planned)

Staged directory maturation. Stages 1–2 (engine package + single canonical schema) are **done** above;
the remaining stages are tracked here so the framework's layout keeps pace with its scope.
- [x] **Directory-map ADR + `ARCHITECTURE.md`** — the layer taxonomy (engine / content / adapters /
      docs) is documented with a "where does a new X go?" placement rule.
      See [ADR-005](docs/decisions/ADR-005-layered-directory-taxonomy.md) and
      [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). *Documented before moving any content, by design.*
- [x] **Clarify the dual-purpose adapters** — done (ADR-011). `bootstrap/seed-manifest.yaml` classifies
      every root entry as `seed` (copy) / `generated` (regenerate via the engine) / `engine` (never copy).
      `eeik seed --into <dir> [--apply]` copies exactly the `seed` set (also `eeik seed --list`,
      `eeik.seed_plan()`), additive to `cp -r`. The seed's own `quality-gate.yml` product jobs self-skip
      on the engine repo (no `pom.xml`/`package.json`/`src/`). A test asserts no engine-only path is ever
      classified `seed`.
- [x] **Consolidate the resolver overlap** — unified on a single canonical matrix at
      `bootstrap/resolvers/capability-matrix.yaml` (all 19 packs, availability-annotated). The duplicate
      stub under `generators/capability-selector/` was removed; its README now redirects to the canonical
      file and states plainly that the *authoritative* resolver is code (`eeik/packs.py::resolve_packs`) —
      the matrix is human-readable reference. `eeik/packs.py::MATRIX_FILE` repointed accordingly; APEX's
      vendored copy + `PROVENANCE.md` re-synced (availability corrected: all 19 built, azure/gcp/retail
      remain v2.0).

---

## v1.2 — Domain Capability Packs (Complete)

Domain-specific packs, now substantive (agents + standards + knowledge) and conformance-checked by
`eeik verify` — the catalog advertises only agents that exist.

### Delivered
- [x] **Python capability pack** — `python-developer`, `fastapi-engineer`; python + fastapi standards.
- [x] **Go capability pack** — `go-developer`, `go-microservices-engineer`; go-standard (cloud-native,
      std-lib-first, gRPC/protobuf, `context`, table-driven `-race` tests). `technology.backend.language:
      go` resolves it (schema enum + resolver + matrix extended).
- [x] **Node.js / TypeScript capability pack** — `node-developer`, `typescript-api-engineer`;
      node-standard (strict TS, Zod boundaries, NestJS/Fastify, Vitest, `pino`). Resolves on
      `technology.backend.language: node`.
- [x] **Retail domain pack** — `retail-domain-expert`, `ecommerce-specialist`; retail-standard (catalog /
      cart-checkout / inventory-reservation / order state machine / PCI-DSS tokenised payments / GDPR).
      Resolves on `project.domain: retail` (previously annotated planned-for-v2.0; pulled forward). 22 packs total.
- [x] **Data Engineering pack** — `data-engineer`; data-engineering + data-pipeline standards; lakehouse
      knowledge. (Now auto-resolves from `technology.data.*` — schema + resolver extended.)
- [x] **OpenShift pack** — `openshift-engineer`, `kubernetes-engineer`; openshift standard.
- [x] **Banking domain pack** — `banking-domain-expert`, `payments-specialist` (SWIFT/ISO 20022, SEPA,
      SCA, PCI-DSS); banking-compliance standard. (v1.1)
- [x] **Healthcare domain pack** — `healthcare-domain-expert`, `clinical-data-specialist` (FHIR R4, HL7 v2,
      SNOMED/LOINC, HIPAA); healthcare-compliance standard. (v1.1)

---

## v1.3 — Reference Architectures

Complete, engine-surfaced reference architectures for common enterprise patterns. Each is a machine-
readable blueprint (`reference.yaml`), a **schema-valid manifest** you can feed to `eeik resolve-packs` /
the repository-generator, an `architecture.md`, and a `runbook.md`. `eeik architectures` lists them and
`eeik verify` checks each one still validates and resolves to the packs it declares (ADR-010).

### Delivered
- [x] **Order Management Microservice** — event-driven Spring Boot 3 / Java 21 / Aurora / Kafka on AWS;
      DDD, transactional outbox, choreographed saga, CQRS.
- [x] **AI-Augmented Service** — RAG on FastAPI / Bedrock / pgvector, every model call governed by HALO.
- [x] **Data Platform** — Kafka + Spark/Glue + dbt + Airflow + S3 lakehouse + Athena; medallion, idempotent
      ingestion, data-quality gates.
- [x] **Multi-Tenant SaaS** — shared infra + isolated tenants; Cognito identity, PostgreSQL RLS isolation,
      per-tenant metering/billing, noisy-neighbour controls.
- [x] **Engine surfacing + conformance** — `eeik architectures` (CLI), `eeik.reference_architectures()`
      (SDK), `eeik_reference_architectures` (MCP); `eeik verify` asserts manifest validity + pack match.

### Delivered (cont.)
- [x] **Per-architecture CDK stacks + seed data / local dev** — each of the 4 reference architectures now
      ships a deployable `cdk/` (TypeScript AWS CDK app — VPC/Aurora/MSK/ECS, pgvector, medallion
      lakehouse+Glue+Athena, Cognito+RLS as appropriate) and a `local-dev/` (`docker compose up -d` +
      seed data — Postgres/Kafka/MinIO/pgvector, with schema + demo rows). `reference.yaml` gained a
      `deployment` block; `eeik architectures` surfaces it and `eeik verify` asserts each `cdk/` has a
      `cdk.json` and each `local-dev/` a `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## v2.0 — Multi-Cloud & Advanced Patterns

### Planned
- [ ] **Azure capability pack** — AKS, Azure DevOps, Entra ID, Cosmos DB patterns
- [ ] **GCP capability pack** — GKE, Cloud Run, BigQuery, Pub/Sub patterns
- [x] **FinOps pack** — `finops-engineer` + `finops-standard` (cost visibility/allocation, rightsizing,
      RI/Savings-Plans, budgets + anomaly detection, unit economics; Inform→Optimize→Operate). Resolves on
      `cloud.finops: true`.
- [x] **Platform Engineering pack** — `platform-engineer` + `platform-engineering-standard` (IDP, golden
      paths/paved roads, self-service, Backstage, thinnest-viable-platform). Resolves on
      `delivery.platform_engineering: true`.
- [x] **Chaos Engineering pack** — `chaos-engineer` + `chaos-engineering-standard` (hypothesis-driven
      fault injection, blast-radius control, GameDays, SLO/error-budget tie-in). Resolves on
      `observability.chaos_engineering: true`.
- [ ] **Azure / GCP capability packs**, **GraphQL Federation** — remain planned.
- [ ] **GraphQL Federation** — Apollo Federation v2 patterns, subgraph design, gateway configuration

---

## Future Enhancements — Adoption, Distribution & Robustness (evaluation-driven)

Captured from an external evaluation of the repository (2026-08). The project is assessed as a mature,
well-governed engine; the **highest leverage is reducing first-adopter cognitive load and making the
installable engine consumable outside this monorepo**. Items below are planning-only — each carries a
plan and a feasibility read so they can be scheduled without re-deriving the analysis.

**Feasibility legend:** Effort **S** (≤1 day) / **M** (2–5 days) / **L** (>1 week) · Impact **H/M/L** ·
Risk notes call out dependencies or hazards.

### Quick wins (do first — high impact / low-to-moderate effort)
- [x] **Adopter-first README** — Quick Start (seed-first) + badges at the top; the deep engine/MCP/SDK
      walkthrough is collapsed behind a `<details>`.
- [x] **Top-of-repo diagram** — the `requirements → resolve → generate → govern → capture` flow as a
      mermaid diagram in README + ARCHITECTURE.
- [x] **Publish `eeik` to PyPI** — `release.yml` builds sdist+wheel on a version tag and publishes via
      **OIDC trusted publishing** (no stored token), then cuts a GitHub Release; PyPI metadata enriched
      (classifiers/urls/keywords/license) and the schema ships in the wheel. _One-time maintainer setup:
      configure the PyPI Trusted Publisher for this repo + `pypi` environment, then push `vX.Y.Z`._
- [x] **Badges + "Who is this for?"** — added to the README. _GitHub **topics** (`ai-agents`,
      `claude-code`, `github-copilot`, `mcp`, `enterprise`, `bootstrap`) are a one-line repo-settings
      action for a maintainer — recommended list captured here._
- [x] **`CHANGELOG.md`** (Keep a Changelog), **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** (Contributor Covenant), and
      **`SUPPORT.md`** (support + FAQ) added.
- [x] **`eeik doctor`** — **done.** Diagnoses common adoption problems (Python + core deps, HALO and MCP
      availability, manifest validity, pack resolution, adapter materialisation, lock drift, and the
      conformance gate) with an actionable fix per finding; never throws. Three surfaces: `eeik doctor`
      (`--json`/`--strict`/`--exit-code`), `eeik.doctor()` (SDK), `eeik_doctor` (MCP). (`eeik/doctor.py`)

### 1. Accessibility & onboarding ✅ _(shipped v1.4)_
- [x] Restructure README (Quick Start → diagram → "seed vs engine" up front → deep detail collapsed).
      _Effort S · Impact H._
- [x] Make **`docs/index.html` / interactive guide** the default newcomer landing experience; link it
      prominently and keep it in the doc-sync rule. _Effort S · Impact M._ — README now leads with a
      "New to EEIK? Start with the interactive guide" link; the guide opens with a **Get Started**
      section (adopt vs. try-the-engine) mirroring the README Quick Start.
- [x] State the **dual role explicitly and early**: `eeik seed --into <dir>` is the primary *adoption*
      path (copy config into a project); the engine is for *generation* (ADR-011). _Effort S · Impact H._
      — the "Who is this for?" table and Quick Start now split adoption vs. generation up front.

### 2. Packaging, distribution & discoverability
- [x] PyPI publish + release automation — done. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds on tag and
      publishes via **OIDC Trusted Publishing** (no long-lived tokens), gated Java, GitHub Release
      notes. _Maintainer follow-up (outside the repo): register the PyPI Trusted Publisher._
- [x] Badges + "Who is this for?" — done (README carries Python/License/MCP/Governed/Packs badges and a
      "Who is this for?" table). _GitHub **topics** are a maintainer repo-setting, not a repo file._

> **License:** AGPL-3.0 is retained by decision — the strong-copyleft, network-use-disclosure posture is
> intended for this engine. No relicensing is planned; adopters should read `LICENSE` before use.

### 3. Testing & quality
- [x] **Shipped-content smoke test** — done (`tests/test_shipped_content.py`): every pack's metadata is
      well-formed + versioned, the catalog covers all 22 with digests, declared agents resolve, the
      conformance gate is clean, `eeik.doctor()` reports healthy, and every `bootstrap/examples/*.yaml`
      validates + resolves. It immediately surfaced real gaps — see the fixes below.
      - Fixed a validator crash on a malformed manifest (`governance:` as a scalar) — `check_governance_rules`
        / `check_pack_overrides` now coerce non-mapping sections to `{}` (never throw).
      - Rewrote the stale `insurance-modernization.yaml` example (pre-canonical flat format) to the
        canonical schema.
      - Closed schema↔resolver gaps the example exposed: added `technology.mainframe` (platform +
        languages — the resolver + governance rules already read it), and the `anti-corruption-layer`
        pattern + `solvency-ii` / `basel-iii` compliance frameworks used by the domain packs.
- [x] Broaden edge-case coverage + **pack materialization / adapter generation** tests — done.
      `tests/test_adapters.py` (10 cases) drives the kiro/codex/cursor/gemini generators into a temp
      root — files land where expected, carry the generated-by banner, JSON/JSONC parses, dry-run
      writes nothing, empty manifests still generate. `tests/test_materialization.py` (7 cases) drives
      `activate()` — managed-marker stamping, dry-run safety, skip-on-exists, `--clean` removes only
      managed files, missing pack dir is a no-op. (Also hardened `packs.py` logging to not crash when a
      target lives outside the repo root — the same defensive `_rel` pattern used in `lint.py`.)
- [x] **CI matrix Python 3.11/3.12/3.13** + **coverage floor** — done. `eeik-validate.yml` engine-tests
      runs the suite across 3.11/3.12/3.13 with `--cov=eeik --cov-fail-under=50` (currently ~57%) and
      uploads a coverage artifact per version. `pytest-cov` added to the `test` extra.
- [x] **Hook tests** — done. `tests/test_hooks.py` drives the shell guards via subprocess (JSON on
      stdin → exit code): `pre-bash-guard` blocks force-push / hard-reset / `rm -rf` system dirs / DROP
      DATABASE / cdk destroy / destructive AWS (and *warns* on protected-branch push); `pre-write-guard`
      blocks system paths / keys / `.env.production`; `post-edit-check` warns but never blocks. 30 cases.
- [x] **Content linting beyond agent-lint** — done. `eeik lint` checks agent/standard content
      well-formedness (frontmatter validity, name-matches-file, description length band, model/tools,
      body structure) with `pass`/`warn`/`fail` levels; three surfaces (`eeik lint`, `eeik.lint()`,
      `eeik_lint`). It replaces the inline frontmatter grep in `eeik-validate.yml` and immediately caught
      two `.claude/agents/` files the grep missed (materialised-marker handling). (`eeik/lint.py`)

### 4. Content & capability packs
- [x] **Adapter parity matrix** — documented per-tool depth + the parity goal (standards/context at
      parity across all six; format-appropriate agent/command granularity) in
      [docs/reference/adapter-parity.md](reference/adapter-parity.md). _Closing the granularity gap for
      the thin adapters remains ongoing generator work._
- [x] **Domain-pack contribution criteria** — added to CONTRIBUTING: generic + extensible (not
      org-specific), substantive content passing `lint`/`verify`, generic regulated framing, versioned +
      resolver-wired, patterns over prescriptions.
- [ ] Expand **reference architectures**; keep every manifest schema-valid and resolving cleanly (already
      verify-gated). _Effort M · Impact M._
      - [x] **multi-agent-ai-platform** — promoted the stray prose blueprint into a full engine-surfaced
        architecture (supervisor + workers on HALO): resolving manifest, `reference.yaml`, architecture +
        runbook, CDK app (Fargate + DynamoDB checkpoints/audit + least-privilege Bedrock), and DynamoDB-Local
        docker-compose. `eeik verify` gates it.
      - [x] **event-driven-microservices** — Kafka + saga/outbox + CQRS on Spring Boot/Java 21: resolving
        manifest (`core, architecture, aws, containers, delivery, governance, java`), `reference.yaml`,
        architecture + runbook (outbox/saga/DLQ ops), CDK app (MSK + Aurora + Fargate edge), and a
        Kafka+Schema-Registry+Postgres docker-compose with an outbox schema. Added `technology.containerisation`
        to the schema (the resolver already read it). **6 architectures** now.
        Further candidate: regulated-banking-platform.
- [x] Strengthen **closed-loop capture** — documented the **staged → committed** promotion workflow
      (7-step curation checklist: review → curate stubs → de-dup → number → move + index → maybe promote
      to a pattern → commit) in `knowledge/lessons-learned/README.md`.

### 5. Engine & governance robustness
- [x] **Document the HALO-absent experience precisely** — done: a "what works offline (with/without
      HALO)" table in [docs/reference/engine-reference.md](reference/engine-reference.md) (everything but
      governed generation works identically; generation runs fail-safe/ungoverned without HALO;
      `auto_enforced` is always `False`).
- [x] **Preview / dry-run generation mode** — done. `preview=True` (SDK `eeik.generate(..., preview=True)`,
      MCP `eeik_generate` `preview`, CLI `eeik demo --preview`) runs the same governed path — the gate
      still runs, `auto_enforced` stays `False` — but does **not** persist to `.eeik-staging/`; the
      artifact is returned in-memory (`staged=False`). Never weakens SUGGEST authority; just skips
      persistence. (`eeik/generation.py::run_generation`)
- [x] **MCP production notes** — done. [engine-reference.md](reference/engine-reference.md) covers host
      configs (`.mcp.json` / `python -m eeik mcp`) and a "Running MCP in production" section (put
      auth/mTLS + rate-limiting at the gateway, filesystem isolation, least-privilege read-only subset).
- [x] **`eeik doctor`** delivered (see Quick wins). _Effort M · Impact H._
- [x] **Consistent `--json` on inspection commands** — `status`, `validate`, and `diff` now emit `--json`
      alongside catalog/architectures/verify/doctor/lessons; the `diff` payload matches
      `eeik.pack_drift().to_dict()` so there is one drift schema across CLI/SDK/MCP. (Remaining
      non-inspection commands — activate/generate-adapters/seed apply — stay human-only by design.)

### 6. Documentation & process
- [x] Keep **Tier 4** items marked done (resolver + dual-purpose adapters are closed — reflected above).
      _housekeeping._
- [x] **"First contribution" path** in CONTRIBUTING — done. A "Your First Contribution" section (four
      graded single-file starts) plus a "Local Development Setup" section (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`,
      `pre-commit install`, and the exact ruff/mypy/lint/verify/pytest commands CI runs).
- [x] **Engine security model** section in SECURITY.md — done. Documents what the `eeik` package does /
      doesn't do (reads content layers; writes only to `.claude/` + `.eeik-staging/`; no network in the
      core; no arbitrary code execution; no secret handling; no auto-apply), the HALO/fail-safe posture,
      the read-first MCP surface, and the pack digest/lockfile supply-chain guarantee.
- [x] `CHANGELOG.md` + `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` + SUPPORT/FAQ — done (all three shipped; CHANGELOG follows
      Keep a Changelog and tracks the v1.4 engine track).

### 7. Operational / CI polish
- [x] **Dependabot** for Python deps + GitHub Actions — done. `.github/dependabot.yml` runs weekly for
      the `pip` and `github-actions` ecosystems, groups minor/patch bumps, and uses Conventional-Commit
      prefixes (`build(deps)` / `ci(deps)`).
- [x] **Pre-commit hooks** mirroring CI locally — done. `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: hygiene hooks +
      `ruff check` + `mypy` + local `eeik lint` / `eeik verify --strict` gates. Backed by new
      `[tool.ruff]` / `[tool.mypy]` config in `pyproject.toml` and `ruff`/`mypy`/`types-PyYAML`/
      `pre-commit` in the `dev` extra. Formatting is lint-guided, not wholesale-reformatted (the engine's
      deliberate column-alignment is preserved). Fixed the ruff/mypy findings this surfaced along the way.
- [ ] Make **`eeik verify --strict --exit-code`** and **`eeik diff --exit-code`** *required* status
      checks (branch protection). _Effort S · Impact H · repo-admin setting; both already run green in
      `eeik-validate.yml`._
- [x] **Upload catalog/verify reports as CI artifacts** on failure — done. `eeik-validate.yml`
      engine-tests now writes `catalog`/`verify`/`doctor`/`diff` `--json` to `ci-reports/` and uploads
      them as an `eeik-diagnostics-<py>` artifact **on failure**, so a red gate is debuggable from the
      artifact alone.

### 8. Longer-term strategic
- [x] **Composable packs — first cut** — the resolver now consumes the per-pack `dependencies.yaml`
      model that already shipped as content but was previously ignored. `resolve_packs` transitively
      pulls in a selected pack's declared dependencies (existing-only, cycle-safe — e.g. `agent-harness`
      → `governance`), in trigger-driven mode only (explicit `capability_packs.explicit` stays exact,
      and an `exclude` still vetoes a pulled-in dependency). Conflict detection lands alongside:
      `eeik.pack_conflicts()` (SDK) + a `pack-conflicts` **`eeik doctor`** check read an optional
      `conflicts:` list and surface incompatible resolved pairs (no shipped pack declares one, so the
      gate is clean today). `expand_dependencies` / `detect_conflicts` in `eeik/packs.py`, tested in
      `tests/test_composable_packs.py`. _Remaining (deferred): version-constrained dependencies and a
      declared `conflicts:` in real packs once a genuine incompatibility exists._
- [x] **Opt-in telemetry** — done, **strictly opt-in + local-first + non-identifying** (the privacy bar
      the item required). `eeik/telemetry.py` keeps aggregate pack/generator counters in
      `~/.eeik/telemetry.json` **only after** `eeik telemetry --enable` (or `EEIK_TELEMETRY=1`); there is
      no network code in the module (nothing is transmitted), `record()` is a hard no-op otherwise and
      never raises. CLI `eeik telemetry [--enable|--disable|--clear|--json]`. Documented in SECURITY.md.
- [ ] **Enterprise story** — private pack registries, **signed packs** (provenance beyond the content
      digest), air-gapped install. _Effort L · Impact H (enterprise) · builds on `eeik.lock` digests._
- [x] **Broader tool support** — added **Windsurf** (`.windsurf/rules/`) and **Cline** (`.clinerules/`)
      generators to `eeik generate-adapters` (8 tools now); standards/context at parity. Further surfaces
      plug in via the same registry. _Effort M each · Impact M._
- [ ] **Broader tool support (ongoing)** — new AI coding surfaces as they appear, via the adapter generator. _Effort
      M each · Impact M._
- [x] **Stable APEX integration surface** — documented as a **versioned contract** (v1.0) in
      [docs/reference/apex-integration-contract.md](reference/apex-integration-contract.md): the stable
      SDK/MCP read-model + governed-write surface, the three consumption modes (SDK/MCP/vendored
      fallback), semver rules, and the invariants a consumer can assert (one drift schema, stable
      resolve order, generation never auto-applies, read-model never needs HALO). _protects the primary consumer._

> Scheduling note: the **Quick wins** block is **done** — the "v1.5 — Adoption & Distribution"
> increment (adopter-first README + diagram, PyPI release workflow, badges, CHANGELOG /
> CODE_OF_CONDUCT / SUPPORT, `eeik doctor`, shipped-content smoke test, Python matrix + coverage).
> Remaining higher-effort items sit in sections 1–8 below; **composable packs** is the one needing a
> deliberate design decision, not just implementation. (The license question is settled — AGPL-3.0 is
> retained.) Two follow-ups need a maintainer action outside the repo: configure the PyPI Trusted
> Publisher, and set the GitHub topics.
