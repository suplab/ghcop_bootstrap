"""eeik — the EEIK bootstrap engine.

An installable Python package: the executable core of EEIK (manifest validation, capability-pack
activation, multi-tool adapter generation, pack versioning + drift detection, and HALO-governed
generation). The engine operates on the repository's *content* layers (``capability-packs/``,
``knowledge/``, ``templates/``, ``generators/``, ``bootstrap/``), which are data, not code.

Console entry point ``eeik`` (see pyproject.toml); also runnable as ``python -m eeik``.

# Public SDK surface (ADR-007) — `import eeik; eeik.validate_manifest(...)`. These names and their
# return shapes are the supported contract; everything else in the package is internal. (The CLI
# dispatches subcommands in-process — see cli.py — so this eager import does not trigger the
# `python -m` re-execution warning.)
